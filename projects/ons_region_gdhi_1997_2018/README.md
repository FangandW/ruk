## ONS Regional Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) 1997 to 2018

GDHI is the amount of money that all individuals in an average regional household have available after they have paid direct and indirect taxes and received any direct benefits.\nGDHI is a concept that is seen to reflect the “material welfare” of the household. Regional estimates are produced in current prices (which include the effects of inflation). [Code](https://github.com/NearAndDistant/ruk/tree/main/projects/ons_region_gdhi_1997_2018)

As with any average we are simplifying for informative purposes and we take on error in this simplification. For instance not everyone in the North East will receive property income, this is an error in our average model that we accept in order to understand a lot of information in a simple way. The fact is that we know if we multiplied that property income by the 2018 population of the North East we would get to a real figure for how much property income the North East generated in that year. Therein lies a disadvantage to GDHI i.e. that it does not inform us of the distribution across individuals. We would need to look at a different model to understand, for instance, if all property income was collected by one or a small group of individuals (which is probably more likely). This does not mean we don't use GDHI, it just means that what we can say is limited to certain constraints of averages.

#### UK National Accounts

In UK national accounts there is a distinction made between primary and secondary stages of income and payments. Primary stages relates to income and payments arising from production, such as employment and owned assets. Secondary stages relate to income or payments arising from the redistributive process of taxes and social benefits. GDHI is calculated by summing these two stages of income giving us average disposable income. In summary though:

### Primary Stage (production) is made up of:

Operating Surplus - rental income from property
Mixed Income - self-employment income etc.
Compensation - wages and salary
Property Income - income from assets other than property (confusingly)

There is one major expense from primary income which is 'property income, paid' (rent or mortgage payments etc) which gives us the primary balance.

### Secondary Stage (redistributive) is made up of:

Social Benefits - universal credit, child benefits etc
Other Current Transfers - charitable donations and government grants

From our secondary income we pay taxes (or what the ONS calls secondary expenses) giving us our secondary balance, including:

Current taxes - income taxes making up ~85% of secondary expenses
Social contributions - such as National Insurance
Other Current Transfers - non-life insurance payments etc
