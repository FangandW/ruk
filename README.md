## ONS Regional Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) 1997 to 2018

GDHI is the amount of money that all individuals in an average regional household have available after they have paid direct and indirect taxes and received any direct benefits.\nGDHI is a concept that is seen to reflect the “material welfare” of the household. Regional estimates are produced in current prices (which include the effects of inflation). [Code](https://github.com/NearAndDistant/ruk/tree/main/projects/ons_region_gdhi_1997_2018)
